The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
"Then we must castrate even Italians who rape, who are in fact four times more than foreigners according to statistics.",1
"The Arabs do not want to impose their religion. Did you see any Muslim in Italy trying to impose his religion on anyone? If so, where? Explain his theory. The boats are controlled by human traffickers, so you would like that trafficking of human beings was used to bring them back to their homeland?",1
These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
"Freedom of thought, conscience and religion means that you have the right to profess your beliefs, not to impose it on others with symbols introduced in schools.",1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
The idea of,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"They want to conquer the world, we have to defend Italy by blowing them up before they blow us up.",0
"The number of Muslims who have committed certain massacres is insignificant compared to the total number of people living in our cities. Generalizing is always wrong, while condemning the individual crimes.",1
Saying 'Arabs' is a generalization and does not indicate a religion.,1
I do not share your statement. Muslim migrants arriving in Italy seek help because they are the first to be persecuted by the true fanatics in their home countries.,1
What has sharia that does not convince you?,1
"I do not think anyone must adapt to the culture of anyone. Rather, I think that everyone should have the right to live as they prefer and profess their faith freely, as long as respecting the life and religions of people.",1
"We have hundreds of muslims workers that are very quiet in Italy, are they all dormant terrorists?",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
The Muslim religion does not plan to rape women.,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
A real Islamic invasion is taking place.,0
"Hi, I still think that in these cases, religion or nationality have nothing to do with it. Those who commit these acts should be treated as criminals regardless of any other aspect.",1
Don't you believe in the work of our intelligence?,1
How many mosques have you seen in your neighbourhood?,1
"It does not seem correct to me to generalize. If some Arabs are terrorists, that does not mean they all are. Some Italian men kill their partners/wives, does this mean that we are a nation of uxoricides?",1
Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.,0
"In the UK there were in 2018 71,000 incidents of violence against Muslims. Perhaps there are more Christians who hate Muslims, don't you think?",1
The beasts.,0
"You accuse them of terrorism and of wanting to conquer with violence and bombs, and then propose yourself violence and bombs . I do not think this will lead to something positive.",1
"In countries like France at school it is forbidden any religious symbol, from the crucifix to the islamic veil.",1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"There is a growing climate of fear against the Islamic foreigners. Actually foreigners resident in Italy who profess the Orthodox Christian religion are the majority (nearly two million), followed by Muslims (less than a million and a half).",1
"But who? It seems to me that, like many others, they simply want to express their faith freely.",1
"The beasts are able to accommodate their own kind in their communities, if you were at least bestial, you probably would have a greater ability to live together.",1
"In the Quran, there is no sura ordering Muslims to kill people who do not believe in Allah. There is also a chapter which enunciates a principle of religious tolerance.",1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
Do you know by chance the anti-terrorism or prevention of radicalization policies? It's the West that creates the best conditions for the proliferation of extremism.,1
Arab countries have always condemned terrorist acts.,1
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
"Do you say that what leads to acts of terrorism is the country of origin? So, if you are born in Egypt you have smoothed the career?",1
"Living together starting from different roots and the cultural precondition is possible and it will be increasingly frequent and daily, but not easy, we must learn both us and them.",1
Muslims always lie and take advantage of everything.,0
So when there were mafia attacks all the southern people were mobsters?,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
There are also many Italian Muslims why we stop them from practising their beliefs? Why we give this opportunity only to Catholics? Why mosques bother you? And then I assure you that the number of mosques is negligible compared to the number of Catholic churches.,1
"In Italy the highest number of rapes is commited at home, from friends, partners or relatives.",1
It seems to me rather that is taking place a real invasion of fake news.,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
"Careful don't trip over, there is a risk being blind;).",1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"Good evening, I would be interested to read articles and studies on the Arab plan to conquer the West, could you add me links? Thank you.",1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
I do not think that there have been cases of Arabs who have attempted to fill positions of some power in Italy. So why do you say that they want to control us?,1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
Terrorism cannot be fought with violence.,1
Do you ever met a Muslim who has told you to hate Christians?,1
"Violence against women has always been a serious problem, which affects people of all ethnic groups, cultures and religions. It is certainly not a typical Muslim phenomenon.",1
It does not seem to me that there are so many mosques in our cities. Could you provide me some data about their number?,1
"There are Arab terrorists, as there are English terrorists, Italian and French. These stereotypes won't help us to fight terrorism.",1
We live in an increasingly open and multicultural world. Everyone must make an effort to try to live together peacefully.,1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
"You cannot discuss while generalizing a population, the cases should be analyzed individually.",1
The Muslims are all fanatics and want to rule in our home!,0
Violence is always wrong. Also it's repudiated in our constitution. This post is therefore contrary to the principles at the basis of our state.,1
Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.,0
Not all Muslims impose the veil on women.,1
"A person living in conditions of deep social problems and emigrated to another country exports its tradition and religion, and want to maintain them, exactly as the host country wants to maintain its own. This does not mean submission, it means coexistence, exchange, mutual enrichment.",1
Nothing is achieved with violence. We must be able to dialogue and find a point of cohesion between the two religions. Fanaticism is not true Islam. The Muslims who arrive in Italy are the first to be persecuted by the real extremists.,1
Islamics must adapt to our culture and not viceversa.,0
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
Could you please explain your theory on this subject? How can you make such an act?,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
Responding to hatred with hatred is self-destructive.,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"I understand the fear that all these dramatic events in recent years have caused, but you can never respond to violence with more violence or generalizations of this type.",1
These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"Good evening, so you're telling me that you would burn with napalm Arab children?",1
This statement is very cruel. Can you tell me if you strongly believe in this statement? Where does all this anger come from?,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"Terrorism is a widespread phenomenon in the world, among Arab, European, American and many Asian and African peoples. It is not possible to consider all Arabs terrorists. There was terrorism also in Italy: are all Italians terrorists?",1
Napalm. And they are the terrorists?,1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
Napalm and weapons do nothing but generate hatred and hatred promotes terrorism. The answer should be just the opposite: try to resolve conflicts.,1
Do you really think that they have so many bombs?,1
"The respect for each other born like this, accepting the other needs. This will stop fanaticism.",1
How do you figure this invasion?,1
"No one wants to impose anything on anyone. Arabs living in Italy want to live in peace, respecting the law and all citizens, but why do you have this huge desire to find an enemy?",1
Generalizing never brings anything good: the violent are just a fraction of all Muslims.,1
The beasts.,0
Islam is a religion manipulated by terrorism that uses it as a shield. The same thing happened in the years of lead in Italy with terrorism that exploited political ideologies and parties.,1
"Hello, actually the number of Muslims in Italy amount to just under 5% of the total population: do you believe that it is possible to talk about replacing?",1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!",0
"In this world we are all men, no one is an animal. Muslims are people like us and should be treated as such.",1
"I am convinced that, except for a few bad apples, even they want to live together peacefully.",1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"I do not think that talking about invasion is correct. Most migrants that arrive in Italy are distributed in the rest of Europe, where Italy is second last in number of immigrants for inhabitant.",1
"The fanatics represent only a small part of the Muslim population. If you do some research, you will notice that Islam preaches peace. So, why commit violence on innocent people?",1
School is a laic place. The crucifix is,1
"Hello, the case to which I believe you refer would not be absolutely a defined choice based on religious reasons, but for food health issues.",1
"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!",0
"The Arabs are several hundred million if they were all terrorists they would have already destroyed Europe. The terrorists are a minority, which often damages other Arabs: in the attacks committed by Arabs, there have been many more Arab victims than European victims. Much is said about the terrorist attacks in Europe, but there are many more attacks in Asia and Africa.",1
"Statistics say that Italy is last in the list of countries that welcome migrants and refugees with only 2.4 people per 1,000 inhabitants. Insert links, for example https://www.internazionale.it/reportage/annalisa-camilli/2018/06/18/immigrazione-luoghi-comuni-italia.",1
"History has taught us that violence brings nothing but more violence, why do we have to make a similar action?",1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
Did you know that the only terrorist attacks in Italy were made by Italians?,1
Could you give me a source at the base of a such strong statement? Because to me it does not appear that there is this trend going on.,1
"Better a smart bomb. Oh, no. That threatens to hit you.",1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
A real Islamic invasion is taking place.,0
Arab countries have always condemned terrorist acts.,1
"The rapist is a typical Italian product, I would say.",1
"Arabic, Islamic and terrorist are very different terms that we must learn to use. Arab: inhabitants of Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. Muslims: those who profess the religion of Islam Terrorists: Islam extremists.",1
"Even in Europe, there is terrorism, what do we do? Should we throw napalm on us?",1
"Hello, could you give me a figure on the number of Muslims in Italy?",1
In today's world we do not need more violence. Do you believe strongly in this statement? Why?,1
"Hi, in Italy freedom of religion is a fundamental principle: no one has to adapt to a culture, but you must have the right to profess your faith in full freedom and respect for each other I think.",1
Why should we make a war when we could be open for dialogue?,1
"Personally I'd like to deepen the Islamic culture, as well as others with which we are and will increasingly be in contact. I think it would be helpful to be all less ignorant in the interests of peaceful coexistence.",1
"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!",0
"Currently returns consist of delivering to the migrant an expulsion paper that orders him to leave the country on their own. Of course, nobody does it. This is because we do not have the resources to send them away, so at the moment returns do not seem to be the solution to the migration phenomenon.",1
"Actually, terrorism is not an Islamic phenomenon: in America, there is an attack every day, not in the name of Allah.",1
Crime does not depend on nationality and religion.,1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
Based on what you say that the Arabs want to command at our house?,1
There is no contest between mosques and churches.,1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
"It seems to me there is a lot of hate in your comment, where did it come from?",1
I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.,0
"Try to see how many churches there are in Italy and how many mosques. If you lived in Dubai, and the situation was reversed, wouldn't you want that there was at least one church?",1
"Although there are certainly Muslims who have committed horrendous crimes, I find it unfair to generalize and condemn an ",1
Muslims have no intention of returning to the Middle Ages: the integralists are a minority.,1
"Competition is good for the free market, perhaps with more choice, we earn heaven.",1
"Generalizing has never led to anything good. I remind you that even in Italy we have had our terrorists. Saying that all Arabs are terrorists because of few individuals is like saying that all Christians are terrorists of the Red Brigades at home, for example.",1
The explosion of an atomic bomb would lead to catastrophic consequences that would affect everyone. So why should we throw it? And especially why punish a population-based only on prejudices? Wouldn't be better to first talk and understand really who is a certain type of person?,1
"To me no Arab has ever imposed anything. Next week I will see my friend Amsa, who is senegalese, to exchange Christmas greetings.",1
Napalm. And they are the terrorists?,1
The Arabs are a people rich in culture and history and also in contradictions as the so-called Westerns and inciting hatred is uncivilized and blind.,1
Your statement is a lawsuit.,1
Could you show me with precision at what diseases do you refer?,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"Unfortunately, violence against women has no nationality, color or religion. It must be fought in any case, not only if it is committed by a Muslim.",1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
And war it is.You don't pass over here troglodytes.,0
The beasts.,0
"Although there are certainly Muslims who have committed horrendous crimes, I find it unfair to generalize and condemn an ",1
"Who are you to judge in such a merciless manner, God Almighty?",1
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
"I do not think that people requesting political asylum in Italy come here for no reason. They flee because in their homeland there wasn't a situation that favoured their stay. We cannot talk about a replacement because the Muslim population represents only a small part of the total Italian population. Men do not hit women, and only the most radical forms of Islam impose the burqa.",1
No Arab has ever tried to impose their religion to an Italian.,1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
I do not see the link between Islamism and diseases.,1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.,0
They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.,0
"The image that the media give of Islam, as a warmongering religion, which seeks to conquer the West and to fight Christians in the world, is false and instrumental. It was clearly said to Vatican Radio by the great imam Ahmad al-Tayyib, recently received from Pope Francis: 'Islam has nothing to do with terrorism. And those who kill Muslims and even kill Christians have misunderstood Islam texts either intentionally or through negligence. ' the University of Cairo that he heads is committed to clarify the concepts of the Koran, which are diverted from armed movements that use violence and terrorism, claiming to work for peace. 'we cannot blame religions,' added the Grand Imam, 'because of the deviations of some of their followers.'.",1
"Let's hope they call good architects, my parish seems a huge garage of concrete.",1
"Well, you want to send in the middle of the sea poor persons, who hates whom?",1
We Italians would never want to be generalized with the crimes committed by our fellow mobsters. Why should we do the same with foreign citizens or of other religions?,1
"To my knowledge, It does not result to me that crucifixes disappeared in schools.",1
"In the Koran, there is not even a word that can legitimize or at least justify terrorism. I invite to read it to enrich the general culture.",1
A real Islamic invasion is taking place.,0
And based on what do you say it?,1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
I wish all of them would die.,0
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"I would not call them troglodytes. Think that Arabs are the founders of algebra, chemistry and modern medicine.",1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"Good evening, send them back home for what accomplished crime? Freely practice their religion?",1
Better that people can pray in mosques open to the public rather than in secret.,1
"Not all Muslims are potential terrorists, Islam and democracy can get along very well.",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"Generalization is always misleading. Arabs are not all terrorists, some of them are; as if someone in the 70s said that Italians were all members of the Red Brigade. Battisti, who in recent days has been arrested and others were, but they were still a handful of people when compared to the number of inhabitants of Italy, so we are wrong every time we throw the baby out with the bath water.",1
Selective Napalm? We throw it over our city and we hopeit will hit the Arabs?,1
"Good evening, given that not all Arabs are of the Islamic faith. In any case, how are they trying to impose their religion?",1
"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!",0
"Better a smart bomb. Oh, no. That threatens to hit you.",1
Islamics must adapt to our culture and not viceversa.,0
Why? Have you bought the Italian territory? And all the resources that we steal to their territories?,1
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
"A criminal should be treated like a criminal, a person - even if with a religious belief different from mine - must be respected as a person.",1
Throwing the baby out with the bath water creates a useless hate.,1
"If it was true, we should rather be concerned to defend these women.",1
"It does not seem to me that most Muslims hate Christians: only a fraction kills for the faith, but can we consider them truly religious?",1
"Hello, actually the data show that the majority of immigrants in Italy are Christian-Orthodox and non-Muslim faith: the situation is very diverse and I do not think we can speak of invasion when the number of Muslims in Italy (including Italian citizens) is just under 5%.",1
"Although many newspapers tend to create this impression, non-tolerant Muslims are very few. Most do not want to impose their religion.",1
Do you not believe that everyone should be free to practice their religion?,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"Hi, I do not think that those who profess the true Muslim faith can admit violence against women or non-respect for freedom of religion. The Koran makes no references in this sense, those who act in this way are doing it going against the same provisions of belief that say to be inspired.",1
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
"Do you think that it's plausible to think that our country in a few years will be controlled by Muslims, that they will impose us the way in which they think, dress, live .?",1
Aren't you the one who hate Muslims?,1
Islamics must adapt to our culture and not viceversa.,0
"The last bastion that we will have, will be the atomic bomb.",0
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0

Battisti, who in recent days has been arrested and others were, but they were still a handful of people when compared to the number of inhabitants of Italy, so we are wrong every time we throw the baby out with the bath water.",1
Where did you get data to confirm this statement?,1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
"Responding to violence with violence is never the best answer. And history should teach us. Also, it would be good to do not throw the baby out with the bath water. Terrorism is not just a given geographic or ethnic belonging.",1
A real Islamic invasion is taking place.,0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"They want to conquer the world, we have to defend Italy by blowing them up before they blow us up.",0
First Italians even in raping women?,1
"We must send home (perhaps not on the boats) who violates the law: this according to the Italian constitution, which provides rights also for foreigners.",1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
Answering to violence with violence is not a solution.,1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
We bombard also Lombardy because there are corrupts and Campania because there is the Camorra? For a few guilty we cannot generalize.,1
"We rape our women, actually.",1
Nothing is achieved with violence. We must be able to dialogue and find a point of cohesion between the two religions. Fanaticism is not true Islam. The Muslims who arrive in Italy are the first to be persecuted by the real extremists.,1
"It does not appear to me that so many mosques have been built in recent years, yet it would be a better way also to isolate the extremists.",1
The majority of immigrants in Italy is Catholic.,1
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
"Rape and violence against women exist, unfortunately, in all the world, regardless of culture or geographic location.",1
"Excuse me, but why should the Arabs want to conquer us with violence and bombs?",1
"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!",0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"Good evening, think that the figures show that 4 of 5 women are raped by Italians. Can you bring data to support his theory?",1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
"Islamists represent a very low percentage of the Italian population, there are 10 mosques compared to more than 66,000 churches, so what data are you referring to?",1
These animals.,0
"Violence against women is mostly domestic, made by Italian close to the victims.",1
"If you really want to send them back, it costs less a plane ticket than a trip on the boat. Do you know that only the wealthiest can come to Italy, many of whom are graduated from university? Try to imagine if the same treatment was reserved for our 'brain-drain' abroad.",1
"Our whom? If it relates to the Italian women I have and I do not feel safe in reading your words. The problem is not Muslims, but the too local mentality in which man feels the woman his property.",1
Christian churches can establish peaceful relations with Muslims. If we do not learn to talk we can never get to the peaceful co-existence.,1
"We will suffer from hunger if the economy collapses, certainly not for a religion.",1
"The vast majority of Muslims is simply interested in practicing their religion peacefully, we should not confuse them with the few extremists.",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"I did not know the Islamists were all sick, what disease is this?",1
They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.,0
"Yeah, because here in Italy no one has ever beat his wife .",1
I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.,0
"Arab is only a generic word precisely as Europeans or Americans that does not consider the many differences existing and in any case, sow fear is the true gesture that should be condemned.",1
"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!",0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"Many of the recent Islamist terrorist attacks were not made by Arabs. For example, Turks, Iranians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis etc. Are not Arabs.",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!",0
"A friend of mine married a Muslim man. He is always so sweet, takes her hand across the road, he opens her the door when entering a room. Gestures that I hardly see in all men. He will not be better than others because he's a Muslim, what I'm certain about is that he is not even worse because he's a Muslim. Let's stop identifying evil in such a banal way.",1
What kind of changes do you fear that could happen?,1
"Hi, do you think that it's really possible to talk about substitution when the number of citizens of the Muslim faith (including Italian) does not even reach 5% of the total population?",1
I do not feel controlled by anyone. What about you?,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"It seems that there are always more people that believe that Islam is directly tied to terrorism. Actually, this belief is the result of a hard to kill stereotype that damages the dignity of Muslims and their religion which is actually like ours, a religion that has like basic principles the love of God/Allah and the brotherhood among men.",1
"Good evening, so you're telling me that you would burn with napalm Arab children?",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"Do not you think it is unfair to blame an entire category of persons defined by you 'Arab' for the actions of a few? Crime and terrorism, unfortunately, have always existed and always have different colours and ethnic groups. There are Arab terrorists as Italian terrorists.",1
"Although in Italy we have tens of thousands of Muslim immigrants, I do not remember many cases of bombs on our territory. Do you have different information?",1
Criticism based on prejudice and ignorance.,1
"I do not believe that they are replacing us, because in Italy the Islamic religion population is only 4%. Women can choose to wear the veil or not, and only the most radical forms of Islam require the use of the burqa.",1
History teaches that Christians wanted to impose their religion at the home of others.,1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
Do not you think you're exaggerating?,1
"Arab population is full of differences inside itself, they are not all terrorists.",1
No one wants to have more places of worship of others. There are citizens who want a place of worship close to home.,1
And war it is.You don't pass over here troglodytes.,0
"Eye for eye, tooth for tooth and are we going back to the Middle Ages? Who commits an act so heinous must pay his debt, in prison, according to the law. You know that if any Italian woman beaten and raped by her husband, the partner and sometimes even by his father, would denounce the violence, prisons would be full of italian men. You've never seen 'Amore Criminale'? It is a great program that speaks about the subject, taking the cue from the most egregious cases, look for it on 'Raiplay'.",1
Everyone must be able to express their faith.,1
I am not aware that they have been removed. From what can you do this statement?,1

"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
The public education should be laic in respect of all religious confessions.,1
Animals for what reason?,1
"In what way they want to impose their religion? We are rather seeking to impose ours, not having any rights.",1
"Men's violence against women is a problem, but not connected in any way to religion or colour of skin. As not all men are rapists. No generalization is ever 100% true.",1
These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
According to what do you state that Arabs want to command in Italy?,1
"In Italy we have had no recent attack by Arabs. Moreover, even in European countries where these despicable events took place, it was not an action of conquest, but only terrorist actions.",1
"Fanaticism is always dangerous, but you do not fight, when there is, with more fanaticism.",1
"Muslims don't hate Christians, generalization is never good!",1
Do you know by chance the anti-terrorism or prevention of radicalization policies? It's the West that creates the best conditions for the proliferation of extremism.,1
So you also agree with castration of all the husbands / boyfriends / violent fellow that have Italian origin?,1
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
I wish all of them would die.,0
I think it is the opposite. If the majority of Muslims feel accepted in their demands there will be less space for the fundamentalists.,1
Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.,0
"Historically the most violent, bloody and oppressor population has been the Europe one, so I would say that we cannot generalize completely.",1
"Hi, what do you mean for Muslims? Do you really consider all on the same level or it wouldn't be better to differentiate between those who profess their faith while respecting the faith of the other and who does not follow the instructions of their own faith?",1

Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
And the cases of violence made by Italians? How do you explain them according to your logic? Do we also castrate them?,1
"The Quran explicitly says that the principles of Islam can only be transmitted without using force. So I guess you are mentioning the extremist forms of Islam, which are a minority compared to the whole of religion. We cannot send back migrants because this action would go against our Constitution, which says that you must receive asylum seekers if in their countries the conditions are such as dangerous to endanger them.",1
"The most severe forms of violence are made by partners, relatives or friends. The rapes are committed by partners in 62.7% of cases, in 3.6% and 9.4% by relatives of friends. We are talking about Italians.",1
"Not all Muslims are against Christians, the ones you mention are only a small part that does not represent the Islamic religion.",1

"The real oppression is to forbid a person to profess their religion, as sanctioned in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The veil is not imposed by Islam, at most by oppressive regimes that with the true nature of Islam have nothing to do.",1

"Good evening, the main victims of the terrorist attacks are the inhabitants of Arab countries. For the most part, then, they are victims, not terrorists.",1
It's not just Muslims who rape women. The punishment that you propose does not seem effective to me. The judge of a court decides the real punishment for a rapist.,1
History is a bad teacher. Our job is not to repeat the mistakes that have been made previously. So why we must still perform these atrocities?,1
"There are Arab terrorists, as there are English terrorists, Italian and French. These stereotypes won't help us to fight terrorism.",1
"The problem lies in having a more open, secular and human mentality without blinders.",1
Words of wisdom learned on some pseudo-populist notice board?,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.,0
I believe that the crucifix in school is a lack of respect for those who are not believers or have a different faith than Christianity.,1
There are very few mosques in Italy compared to the churches.,1
"The last bastion that we will have, will be the atomic bomb.",0
"I do not see which competition can exist between the churches and the mosques, we can go to one or the other according to our faith. They are not supermarkets that offer discounts.",1

These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
"You aren't ready to try to understand a not very different culture as Muslim, but you would be willing to accept willingly a Martian. Interesting point of view.",1
"From what source did you obtain this information? Can you send me the sources, please?",1
"An answer like that so indiscriminate seems not a solution to me to migration; people that arrive in Italy are not here to 'conquer' us, they come to try to have a better future.",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
The cultures can co-exist if there is the value of mutual respect.,1
"It is absolutely untrue that they want to impose their religion, there is no such case. They only ask to be able to respect their religion (and that it is respected), even here in Italy.",1
"Our constitution guarantees freedom of worship, so it makes sense that Muslims have places of prayer for them.",1
Women do not belong to no one but themselves and the best way to preserve them is to combat violence commited by men against them.,1

Excuse me but how many Arabs have you know personally?,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
Islam is not a religion of hate; terrorism has different roots.,1
"Why cannot we talk to each other? In this way, we introduce them to our culture and us to theirs. It seems like a good compromise.",1
I exhort you to do some research and you'll find that only a small part of the Italian population is of islamic faith.,1
"Arabic, Islamic and terrorist are very different terms that we must learn to use. Arab: inhabitants of Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. Muslims: those who profess the religion of Islam Terrorists: Islam extremists.",1
Fanatics megalomaniacs. Don't delude you to find cowards waiting for you! We will pass on your dead body and also with great pleasure.,0
"Look, there are still.",1
"Muslims don't hate Christians. Some people, fanatical and radicalized want to cancel the other, it is on those that is necessary to act.",1
This statement is very cruel. Can you tell me if you strongly believe in this statement? Where does all this anger come from?,1
It seems to me that our women are raped by their relatives.,1
Are you comparing men to the beasts only because they have a different culture from you?,1
The number of mosques is related to the number of the faithful.,1
"I am not aware that there is a declaration of war to our country. We have, like all states, but much less than most of those in Europe, a small percentage of immigrants that are Muslim, about 3%.",1
Do you really think that an ordinary and innocent person like us should suffer violence? Why?,1
"The Arabs are not all terrorists. The extremists represent only a small part of the total Muslim population. We should not generalize, but dialogue.",1
"I would not make a religious issue, also Christians commit rape. The issue is not religious nor racial, those who behave in a certain way must be punished.",1
"Today is widespread hostility against the Islamic religion, your words are the proof. In fact the Islamists are nothing more than people who follow and believe in a monotheistic religion that has at its base the love of God and the brotherhood, nothing less than the Christian religion.",1

"Quite right! To each one their own women to rape, Italian women to Italians!",1
"The vast majority of the nearly two billion Muslims are normal people, like me or you, absolutely peaceful. Few radicalized individuals should not make us generalize. In Italy we also had the indigenous terrorism, this should not allow anyone to do the Italian = terrorist juxtaposition.",1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
Why where there is a Muslim community there shouldn't be a mosque?,1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
A real Islamic invasion is taking place.,0
"With violence and wars nothing good is gained, we must instead seek a peaceful solution. If you inform yourself, you will find out that the Arabs are not all terrorists and some are not even Muslims.",1
"Generalizing has never led to anything good. I remind you that even in Italy we have had our terrorists. Saying that all Arabs are terrorists because of few individuals is like saying that all Christians are terrorists of the Red Brigades at home, for example.",1
If the word femicide exists in our vocabulary it is because neither the Italian males are so quiet!,1

The number of mosques in Italy is insignificant compared to the churches and there are no data to show that this number is likely to increase so sharply.,1
"Italy is a laic state and being a place of education for children should be an occasion of comparison between cultures, beyond these controversies.",1
"Terrorism is not a manifestation of Islam, but that is a religion of peace.",1
No religion was born for war. Violent are just a small tiny part that has nothing to do with the Islamic religion like Christianity is a monotheistic religion that is based on the love of God and the brotherhood.,1
Do you have any statistic that proves that they are all terrorists? Or are you just generalizing.,1

"The skin odor that I think you are referring to should not be a reason for discrimination, we are all human after all.",1
"Hi, do you really believe that a peaceful community, whose religion is based on love and brotherhood will lead to a historic recurrence?",1
"I do not think that people requesting political asylum in Italy come here for no reason. They flee because in their homeland there wasn't a situation that favoured their stay. We cannot talk about a replacement because the Muslim population represents only a small part of the total Italian population.

"At my child's school there is, and children from Muslim families do not say anything.",1

"Hello, actually the couscous is also linked to our tradition, especially in south Italy and it is not a matter to impose a practice typical of another religion.

"The vast majority of the nearly two billion Muslims are normal people, like me or you, absolutely peaceful. Few radicalized individuals should not make us generalize. In Italy we also had the indigenous terrorism, this should not allow anyone to do the Italian = terrorist juxtaposition.",1
"And who wins what do they do, resuscitate?",1
"These Muslims now want also to impose their food, only them should eat cous cous! I want my children to eat pork meat, which is good for them.",0
Excuse me but how many Arabs have you know personally?,1
It would be like saying that all Italians are mobsters and kill people with a shotgun or dissolve children in acid. You can never generalize.,1
They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.,0
"I invite you to learn more about the Islamic world, you will discover that Muslims are peaceful people and open to dialogue. Unfortunately, there are cases of extremism, but we can fight it using dialogue and cultural exchange.",1
"But who? It seems to me that, like many others, they simply want to express their faith freely.",1
These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
"Castration according to belonging to a specific religion is something inhuman, being a Muslim does not mean being rapists.",1
"Who was Avveroé? Manzoni says this in his romance ""The Betrothed'. Avveroé was a sage, philosopher and also worthy exponent of the Islamic world when in the West heretics were burned.",1
"There are more than 800 churches only in Rome, and about 10 mosques (of which only 5 with the minaret). They are a minority: none (that I know) has ever had the need to build a new church, but everyone is entitled to a place where to practice their religion. The fact that the Islamic community requires that their right is respected does not mean that they are becoming more than the Christians, or more powerful.",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"All religions want to spread their beliefs, but no one ever does it with compulsion.",1
"There are plenty of examples of Arab people from the second generation, in accordance with their traditions of origin, they are perfectly integrated in Italy.",1
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
"In Europe we have different forms of terrorism eta, ira, even in Italy we have had various forms of terrorism, black and red. Even the Mafia has used terrorist strategies.",1
"Good evening, the main victims of the terrorist attacks are the inhabitants of Arab countries. For the most part, then, they are victims, not terrorists.",1
The beasts.,0
"I almost would like it. As a woman, I can say: a great saving on cosmetic products.",1
"I read in your words a total rejection of Muslims, but I do not understand why: the Muslims are men like many others in the world who believe in a monotheistic religion and practice it, that is far from being devoted to violence or abuse as some of the most violent minorities that maybe you are referring to.",1
The imposition of the burqa regards the most extreme fringe of Muslims.,1
These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
"The veil is linked to a religious tradition, so, this would be possible if we share it with all.",1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"Bombs on you, bad infamous people (enough is enough stinky)",0
"The napalm? So when they are still 'at home'? How sad, stupid generalizations.",1
A real Islamic invasion is taking place.,0
Oh yes? Then they are in good company of sovereign who would like to close doors and gates.,1
The construction of mosques can also facilitate the control of the state on any possible situation of radicalization.,1
How many Muslims have you met in your life to be able to make this kind of judgment?,1
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
"Do you know that the religion that has proselytized most of all in the world, since the time of its foundation was Christianity?",1
Islamics must adapt to our culture and not viceversa.,0
But who says it has to be our future? Religions can live together!,1
"Saying that the Arabs want to impose their religion is wrong also as a concept: not all Arabs are Muslims, some are Christians like many Italians.",1
These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
Reading comments of women who can write such nasty statements is even sadder.,1
It seems to me that the shame of the Italian school are very different.,1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"Hi, his statement is very strong, could you explain better what you mean by 'replace in our house'?",1
"According to the law, irregular immigrants can be repatriated, regardless of ethnicity (in this case, however, not on the boats, clearly). By what principle of law it should be repatriated an Arab with a valid permit?",1
These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
Islam is a religion manipulated by terrorism that uses it as a shield. The same thing happened in the years of lead in Italy with terrorism that exploited political ideologies and parties.,1
"Also italians rape, are we going to castrate all of them?",1
Die islamic!,0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"I see that is increasingly widespread a climate of fear against Muslims, even the media do not help to distinguish between the correct and mild faith that the majority of Muslims profess, the speculations of politicians, and the infamous use of the manipulators of Islam, that cover in blood the Middle East and North Africa. But Islam is not terrorism.",1
"Why do you consider Muslims like beasts? Did they do something wrong? If you take into consideration the crimes committed by Muslims, why do you distinguish the Muslim criminals from the non-Muslim? They are all criminals and all of them are punished.",1
These animals.,0

The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"Hi, are you suggesting castration as a punishment in a civilized country like Italy?",1
"The phenomenon of terrorism is surely to keep under control, but do you know how many Muslims there are in the world, and how many terrorists?",1
"Your statement is very strong, based on what do you think that the Arabs want to impose their religion and command at our home? I do not see many Arabs in Italy and I do not even see actions in this direction, but perhaps I was not careful enough, if you helped me with some data I would be grateful.",1
If you would inform yourself and you would make a comparison between the number of churches and the number of mosques you would understand that what you are saying is false. And the number of mosques is far inferior to the number of churches.,1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.,0
"The Arabs are not all terrorists. The extremists represent only a small part of the total Muslim population. We should not generalize, but dialogue.",1
"I do not think you have to generalize the fact of extremism to the entire Islamic population. Is a mistake that many people make. Not all Muslims are terrorists. You have to talk to them, not to kill them.",1
"I do not think so, we westerners will arrive sooner to destroy the world.",1
Has anyone ever tried to convert you? Me nobody.,1
Perhaps to wish death at people is not the right approach to use.,1
"Not all Arabs are terrorists, in fact, many attacks damage also Arab people.",1
Revenge is always wrong. Also it is not correct to generalize because the majority of Islamic terrorism victims are Muslims themselves.,1
"But Salvini had not said that he would have repatriated them all with planes? Now we're back to the boats, don't you see that you racists can't be consistent?",1
We must invest in integration policies that allow us to bring together different cultures.,1
"Many victims of terrorism are Arab people, as many terrorists in history have been Italian. Victims and offenders, including terrorism, haven't a specific ethnicity or skin colour.",1
"On what basis do you do these statements? Actually, there are criminals everywhere and they have different ethnicities and religious affiliations. There are Italian rapists and Catholic priests that are paedophiles. But these cases should not allow us to identify all persons as criminals belonging to these categories.",1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!",0
And reading it we can say that Christians hate Muslims.,1
The majority of Muslims live together peacefully with Christians without creating any problem. Terrorists in most cases were not even practicing Muslims.,1
"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!",0
The public school is laic: the crucifix should not really be there.,1
A real Islamic invasion is taking place.,0
"As specified in the reports of various associations such as Amnesty report, the violation of human rights is far distributed in the world. Western states do not shine for lack of violence, especially to foreign countries.",1
"As Italians are all mobsters, the Germans are all Nazis, but as you will know these are prejudices, such as yours on Arabs.",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
The number of mosques in Italy is totally insignificant.,1
Being devoted to a religion does not mean proselytizing.,1
I do not see how belonging to the Muslim religion can somehow bring damage to others or spread diseases.,1
Let's not generalize. Being a Muslim does not mean being criminals and terrorists.,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"Dear, the reality is quite different, unfortunately for women, and for all of us, most of the violence is committed by Italians, read here https://www.istat.it/it/violenza-sulle-donne/il-fenomeno/violenza-dentro-e-fuori-la-famiglia/numero-delle-vittime-e-forme-di-violenza.",1

The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
It burns you up some business went sideways on a journey or had you studied at the 'Bar Sport'?,1
On what data and statistics do you make this statement?,1
Do you know the case of a Muslim who tried to close a church? I would be very curious to hear a story about that.,1
Are you saying you would go with great pleasure on dead bodies?,1
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
But are we really still behind these bar's stereotypes ?,1
"Generalizing is always wrong. I also condemn those who commit certain crimes, but regardless of their religious beliefs or their nationality.",1
There is no better way to spread the terrorism that responding with violence.,1
The integration while respecting the traditions of all is the solution in many cases it is already happening.,1

The beasts.,0
From what do you presume it? Did you inform yourself well before writing the comment? I ask you to perform in-depth research.,1
From where do you obtained this information?,1
In the Koran it is clearly said that Christians and Jews should be respected.,1

"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
For all who are you referring to? Your statement is very general.,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"The question of the veil is open. The same Muslim women in some countries are struggling to get rid of it, for example, in Iran. We have to support their struggle.",1

On the same boat is a saying that should unite and remember that luck is a fickle thing.,1
"If you refer to extremists those exist in every religion and faith, it has nothing to do with Islam.",1
"The last bastion that we will have, will be the atomic bomb.",0

The beasts.,0
It's like saying that Italians are all mobsters and they deserve life imprisonment.,1
"The Arabs are several hundred million if they were all terrorists they would have already destroyed Europe. The terrorists are a minority, which often damages other Arabs: in the attacks committed by Arabs, there have been many more Arab victims than European victims. Much is said about the terrorist attacks in Europe, but there are many more attacks in Asia and Africa.",1
"Castration? Do you think it is a punishment to propose in a society that defines itself modern and respects the rights? To me, it seems a medieval punishment.",1
The sins of the individual cannot be sustained by the entire population.,1

How would you feel if for going to church on Sunday you should go to another region?,1

"In Italy, it is easier to die of measles because of those who do not want the vaccines, instead of dying from tropical diseases.",1
Muslims in Italy are about 2% of the population. I find it difficult to think that they become a majority. And in any case many Muslim women do not wear the veil.,1
There are many of them and they will conquer the world.,0
"It's right that every religion can have a place of worship in which to profess their beliefs, as required by our constitution.",1
The ratio between churches and mosques is obviously unbalanced in favour of the first.,1

"I don't think responding to violence with violence has ever solved the problem; I wish however to point out that generalizations like the one you made are misleading, some Arabs are terrorists, as some Italians are mobsters, but not all Arabs are terrorists and not all Italians are mobsters.",1
At school there are people of all faiths and even atheists. Why there should be a crucifix?,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
Do you mean the saudis for arabs?,1
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
"Are you worried that Italians may have competitors? It seems that italian men get busy, a feminicide every 72 hours!",1
Die islamic!,0
"No one is preventing you to profess your religion, you can continue to be a Christian even if the crucifix isn't in schools.",1
"I do not agree. There are really emancipated Muslim women, do you know the models Gigi and Bella Hadid? They are Muslim, did you know?",1
"The last bastion that we will have, will be the atomic bomb.",0
The Islamic religion is not a religion that professes violence. Islamic terrorists have nothing to do with religion.,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
And war it is.You don't pass over here troglodytes.,0
"In Italy everyone is free to practice their religion, also muslims.",1
They do not seem to do all this to me. We must work to find common agreement.,1

They impose us their culture.,0
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0

"I understand the fear linked to these horrendous crimes, but they should be condemned regardless of nationality.",1
"Italy is our home and of all those who seek to escape death and misery, as well as the law, common sense and civil charity want.",1
"Hi, I think that even in such a sensitive time is important not to confuse terrible acts of violence with religion itself, which does not provide in any of its provisions such acts.",1
"It's a horrendous fact, but to generalize and direct the hatred on a single community is infamous. The problem of violence against women, and unfortunately, these hideous crimes are mostly committed by Italians, at home.",1
"Italy is a laic state and as such, schools and public offices should be free from any religious influence. Culture is too precious to be sold to these guerrillas.",1
"Where do you see all this? Frankly, I do not find feedback to your statements.",1
Could you tell me please where did you obtain this information? Because they are not true.,1
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
Islamics must adapt to our culture and not viceversa.,0
They will blow up all of us in order to force us to their faith.,0
"Muslims do not hate anyone, they pray God as Christians, individuals sometimes hate and kill.",1
"Hello, actually the number of Muslims in Italy amount to just under 5% of the total population: do you believe that it is possible to talk about replacing?",1
I wish all of them would die.,0
Aren't you generalizing?,1
"In comparison to cases of violence in Italy made by foreigners, which are 15% of the total, Italians have the 80% at home and proudly the world record as sex tourists in poor countries. The arrogance of money does not exonerate them, that's double violence.",1
The frequency of violence is related to social status more than to religion. Inclusion and social differences are a basic bigger problem from which derive these problems.,1
"With violence and wars nothing good is gained, we must instead seek a peaceful solution. If you inform yourself, you will find out that the Arabs are not all terrorists and some are not even Muslims.",1
"The issue of the Islamic veil is complex, it is not a religious prescription but cultural. Islam has within itself many different positions on the subject.",1
Islamics must adapt to our culture and not viceversa.,0

The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"Responding to violence with violence is never the best answer. And history should teach us. Also, it would be good to do not throw the baby out with the bath water. Terrorism is not just a given geographic or ethnic belonging.",1
"To profess and practice their religion is not 'impose' but to exercise, it's an inalienable right.",1
"The Arabs are not all terrorists, a generalization like this is dangerous, as it is dangerous to think to solve the problem of terrorism by answering with the same violence.",1
"The Italians are all thieves and mobsters, the Swiss are all punctual, Africans are all poor, all Germans are Nazis. But on what basis do you make these statements? .you are just following clichés without any foundation.",1
"Actually, terrorism is not an Islamic phenomenon: in America, there is an attack every day, not in the name of Allah.",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
I do not know any Muslim who raped non-muslim women.,1

The Muslim population has the right to practice their beliefs.,1
"No one has the right to beat his wife, Italian or Muslim. It is illegal, and the law punishes everyone equally.",1
The one about the crucifix removed from schools is a fake news that people like a lot at Christmas.,1

"Gender-based violence is not an Islamic problem, it's a social problem of all.",1
A real Islamic invasion is taking place.,0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
I agree that Muslims should adapt to our environment. But we must also talk to them. Only like this we can create a relationship of coexistence and peace.,1
"Many of the recent Islamist terrorist attacks were not made by Arabs. For example, Turks, Iranians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis etc. Are not Arabs.",1
"We have hundreds of muslims workers that are very quiet in Italy, are they all dormant terrorists?",1
"Terrorism is a widespread phenomenon in the world, among Arab, European, American and many Asian and African peoples. It is not possible to consider all Arabs terrorists. There was terrorism also in Italy: are all Italians terrorists?",1
"Muslims don't hate Christians. Christians have much in common with Muslims in the religious field. Furthermore, the Koran proclaims religious tolerance.",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
"Hi, could you better explain what you mean by Islamic invasion? Could you tell me some datas that support this statement?",1

"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
"Well, if we must castrate all Italians who raped and beat their women, then we should put in jail several of them, because unfortunately when you beat and molest a woman in Italy, even in trials are the women that take a beating.",1
In Italy Muslims are one million and three hundred thousand: it seems logical that they have places in which to pray.,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
Muslims rape our women and must be neutered.,0

These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
"The vast majority of Muslim women living in Europe wear the veil voluntarily, respecting the religious beliefs of Islam, no one imposes it to them! There is no intention to convert to Islam Italian women.",1
"Watch out historical recurrences, this time blast-furnace will light!",0
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
Forcing to have in front of the eyes a religious symbol is respect.,1
"These are stereotypes and prejudices that kill any chance of comparison and that cause intolerance and unjustified hatred. Following the clichés is not constructive, we must inquire and open our mind.",1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"Those who arrive in boats run away from famine, war, violence, moreover, often the situation at their home is also caused by us.",1
"Damn bastards, they want us to close all churches.",0
"The migrants are fleeing from situations where it was impossible to continue to live, they are leaving everything to board themselves on boats with absent safety standards in hope of finding a country where they can live in peace. I do not think that their purpose is to control and impose their religion.",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
It does not seem to me that are Muslims the ones that rape women in Italy.,1
Castration is not provided by our legal system.,1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
Do you mean the saudis for arabs?,1
They impose us their culture.,0
Terrorism does not depend on religion.,1
"Why do you attribute this adjective to Muslims, who are men like us?",1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
But why follow the stereotypes and completely unfounded prejudices without facts and data?,1
"Regarding diseases, it is a fake news that those arriving in Italy bring new illnesses: every immigrant, as soon as arrives on the Italian territory, undergoes medical prophylaxis.",1
"Not true, Muslims are not invaders for definition, and Christianity is still the first religion in Italy.",1
Muslims always lie and take advantage of everything.,0
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
"If we throw bombs and commit violence it's impossible to reach a final and peaceful solution, only new conflicts will be generated.",1
"Even in Europe, there is terrorism, what do we do? Should we throw napalm on us?",1
Everyone should be free to express their culture freely.,1
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
Responding with violence is exactly what terrorism aims.,1
The presence of mosques does not threaten our religion.,1
Bombs and napalm are to ban for those who have not yet understood that we would all die.,1
Why it's not possible to find a way that leads to tolerance? Is it necessarly to make such an act on those who you do not know?,1
Do you propose castration even for the two police officers in Florence who raped two foreign tourists (assuming that they are found guilty definitively)?,1
"And thinking that it is thanks to the medicine and science and the culture, brought to the West by Islam that we left the Middle Ages.",1
"Neutering a rapist is like cutting the hand of a thief, the law of retaliation! These concepts are truly medieval!",1
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
"Without a little bit of common sense dangerous statements get out, it is better to think before shoot at random.",1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
Isn't this a cliché?,1
"Stupid generalizations, serious and dangerous.",1
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
Personally I've always reputed them people just like you and me. If you want you can try to explain your point of view.,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"Not all Italians are Christians, and I think that the churches in Italy are not lacking. Certainly, it does not seem trivial to build as many mosques in the near future.",1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
? I do not understand.,1
"Good evening, of what diseases are you talking about? Can you send me the link of medical studies or analyses of the phenomenon that support your theory?",1
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0
"The number of mosques is not even remotely comparable to the number of churches, let's not panic.",1
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
"The path of integration ensures that the respect for individual human rights is acquired. Living with us, and the example we give in this regard will also open their society.",1
"I do not see the problem, so we are all happy, they pray to their god and we pray to ours.",1
"The Islam itself is against terrorism of jihad, we must work with Islam, not criminalize it.",1
The Arabs are a people rich in culture and history and also in contradictions as the so-called Westerns and inciting hatred is uncivilized and blind.,1
"Assuming that no Arab religion, Italian, Spanish, Australian, etc. Exist. And then all religions have their own share of witness and spread of the word. Especially Jehovah's Witnesses and Christians, but I've never heard of Muslims if you are referring to they, who sought to impose their religion even with force.",1
"It's a shame that there is no longer the crucifix in school, a lack of respect.",0
"No woman agrees to be beaten, be unable to break free from a state of violence and submission does not mean wanting to be in it. The veil if chosen freely should not be a problem for those who simply do not choose it.",1
Don't confuse Islam with Isis. Religion does not lead to terrorism.,1
There is no Islamic invasion of the West. If many of the migrants are Arabs it depends only on the fact that most Middle Eastern countries are affected by crises and wars.,1
On what data is based this statement?,1
"I'm sorry if you have had such a dramatic experience, I assure you that living together may also be non-traumatic, and that in most cases it is.",1
"You're generalizing baseless. Violence cause violence, unfortunately, so between responsible and advanced adults always choose the dialogue option. So we won't return to the Middle Ages.",1
It would be better to listen less to hatred and more to rationality.,1
"Although some newspapers represent a reality like this, there is no evidence that Arab citizens want to impose their religion.",1
"Fanaticism is always dangerous, but you do not fight, when there is, with more fanaticism.",1
"If it was true, we should rather be concerned to defend these women.",1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
Why do you define them like that? Explain better.,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
"Islam is a religion of love, the fundamentalism of jihad is not Islamism.",1
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
What elements do you have to say it? Like 'Italians are all mobsters.'.,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"There are more than 800 churches only in Rome, and about 10 mosques (of which only 5 with the minaret). They are a minority: none (that I know) has ever had the need to build a new church, but everyone is entitled to a place where to practice their religion. The fact that the Islamic community requires that their right is respected does not mean that they are becoming more than the Christians, or more powerful.",1
In most schools the crucifix is,1
"Hi, even if I share any disapproval against those who commit acts of such atrocities, I invite you to reflect on the fact that in such cases it is necessary to go beyond any faith or nationality. There is no religion that admits such acts. Those who think that they can subjugate women and commit violence on them, in the name of an alleged faith, act as criminals, not as religious.",1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
Did you know that there are so many Italian Muslims and many Arabs who are not? Arab nationality does not identify with any religion as the Italian nationality decrees not all Italians as Catholics. If you are referring to the Muslim religion I do not believe there is any Muslim who seek to impose his own faith.,1
"Good evening, in what sense control at our home? Creating a party and presenting at the election? With a coup? Where do I find information about it?",1
Muslims and Christians can live together pacefully.,1
I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.,0
The beasts.,0
Terrorism does not depend on religion.,1
"The majority of immigrants are Muslims. It's useless to deny that this invasion, certainly peaceful, will bring in our society the Sharia. Glad you, if sharia represents culture and enrichment!",0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
Islamics must adapt to our culture and not viceversa.,0
"Hi, do you really believe that the decision to introduce in a part of the school menu a food anyway considered healthy as the couscous is a symptom of an alleged will to impose a religion?",1
"The Koran teaches to the faithful to tolerate other religions and to respect them. Muslims can only transmit their own principles, but without using force.",1
No one wants to impose to remove the crucifix in the classroom. It would be nice that at school everyone would be free to believe what they want and children could share the beauty of having different cultures.,1
But who? Where? In what home?,1
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0

The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
Answering to violence with violence is not a solution.,1
Die islamic!,0

The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"In reality, the vast majority of Muslims in Syria or Yemen, for example, of which terrorists are a tiny minority, suffers violence and is bombed. They are victims of profit at all costs, of our arms industry.",1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"So because of Red Brigades also all Italian would be terrorists, because of IRA even all Irish and due to the ETA even all Spanish? In short, here in Europe, we are quite dangerous!",1
A real Islamic invasion is taking place.,0
"Our women whose? Forgive me, but I am a woman, I do not belong to anyone but myself, and I do not think that being Muslim makes someone a violent criminal.",1
Violence is always wrong. Also it's repudiated in our constitution. This post is therefore contrary to the principles at the basis of our state.,1

Can you tell me about an incident in which you found yourself living an attempt of conversion?,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"Hi, could you explain better what you mean?",1
"Where did you obtain this information from? Did you check if your source was reliable, because the official data deny an increase of the Muslim immigrant population in Italy.",1
"Hello, actually the couscous is also linked to our tradition, especially in south Italy and it is not a matter to impose a practice typical of another religion. Many food experts have recommended the introduction of this food (still a free choice) in school canteens because it is considered a suitable food for healthy nutrition.",1
"In the Koran, there is not even a word that can legitimize or at least justify terrorism. I invite to read it to enrich the general culture.",1
"Terrorism has no culture or ethnicity, how do you accuse of terrorism an entire population? What data do you have?",1
Islamics must adapt to our culture and not viceversa.,0
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0
"It is not and cannot be only a matter of adaptation. A culture must be understood and this can only be done with good integration projects. All (Catholic Christians and Buddhists), have to adapt to today's multicultural world.",1
I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.,0
"I read a lot of resentment in your comment. You would welcome more willingly an alien rather than a person exactly like you, but with a different culture?",1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0

"Really, with napalm. And then where? They are not all terrorists as you say, some belong to ISIS but others are people like you and me.",1
I think that it is very offensive to compare men to animals.,1
The rapists of women have nothing in common except the male gender.,1
"So because of Red Brigades also all Italian would be terrorists, because of IRA even all Irish and due to the ETA even all Spanish? In short, here in Europe, we are quite dangerous!",1
"Hi, I do not think that those who profess the true Muslim faith can admit violence against women or non-respect for freedom of religion. The Koran makes no references in this sense, those who act in this way are doing it going against the same provisions of belief that say to be inspired.",1
"Our women mostly suffer abuses especially in the home, in some cases from childhood by a family member.",1
"All extremism cause hatred, even racists hate those who are not like them.",1
Napalm and weapons do nothing but generate hatred and hatred promotes terrorism. The answer should be just the opposite: try to resolve conflicts.,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
"I invite you to inform yourself better and you will notice that Muslims are human beings like us. They will not bring us back to the Middle Ages, indeed they will enrich our culture.",1
These Islamic will bring us back to the Middle Age. We will starve to death and die of diseases that disappeared.,0
"Do you really think that terrorism is an ethnic character? And the mafia, for example, how do you explain it?",1
What is this? A recipe for hell or the will of a serial killer?,1
You would really use incendiary bombs to set fire to people because someone among them could have mental problems?,1
Italy is a laic state. The crucifix should not be at school.,1
"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
Why we shouldn't welcome people fleeing from suffering? Italy is a free country and is a right of every man to get political asylum.,1

"As specified in the reports of various associations such as Amnesty report, the violation of human rights is far distributed in the world. Western states do not shine for lack of violence, especially to foreign countries.",1
A despotic statement that not even Attila would share.,1
I think you read too much ministry official propaganda.,1
This statement that you express in this comment seems wrong. Could you send me the source where you have obtained it?,1

Muslims hate Christians. They want to kill all of us.,0
Responding with violence is exactly what terrorism aims.,1
"We treat terrorists as they are, criminal individuals. And let's leave all the other Muslims living peacefully in our cities alone.",1
The Muslim population in Italy amounts to less than 3% of the total. I do not think it is a number that would allow them to take the power in a few years.,1
Could you tell me please where did you obtain this information? Because they are not true.,1
The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0

"They began to build mosques everywhere, and so they compete with our churches.",0
I would prefer the Martians than these fucking Muslims.,0
I think it's better to learn to live together instead. Sending them home without reason is equivalent to rejecting them and the rejection generates resentment.,1

It does not seem to me to see many Muslims around.,1

The Arabs are all terrorists and they want to conquer us with the violence and the bombs. We must respond with napalm.,0

They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.,0
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
The statistics state that the rapists are almost always Italian.,1
Italy has a laic constitution. The hypothesis of imposition of the veil seems to me a provocation.,1
"Are you saying that you want to fight against women, children and men who are fleeing their country, leaving everything they have in the hope of a better life?",1
Where did you hear this news?,1
Maybe it's the right time to begin to pray!,1
I do not think so. The Muslim population in Italy constitute only 4% of the total population. I wouldn't consider it an invasion.,1
Do you know any Muslim person? I do not think he would like to hear you generalize in this way.,1
I do not see why one or the other have to adapt.,1
I've never heard such a claim.,1

Is the presence of the crucifix the real lack of respect in a laic state.,1
"What does it mean to you to 'impose' their religion? Until proven otherwise, I have never seen Islam being taught in schools as is done with Catholicism.",1
"In reality, the vast majority of Muslims in Syria or Yemen, for example, of which terrorists are a tiny minority, suffers violence and is bombed. They are victims of profit at all costs, of our arms industry.",1
"Islam does not impose the veil, it is always linked to the choice of women, as well as becoming a nun or priest or remain virgin until marriage.",1
"Do you know how many mosques are there in Italy? 10, we have instead 66,994 churches, so what are you referring to exactly?",1
"We live in a laic state, it is right that the crucifix is ",1
It is ridiculous that as a result of a few extremists there are people who say these things.,1
"The pillars of Islam does not preach the imposition of religion, indeed they preach co-existence of religions and tolerance. The majority of Muslim foreigners arrive in Italy, because they fled from the country of origin for war and/or persecution conditions. It would be cruel to send them back there.",1
"Arab population is full of differences inside itself, they are not all terrorists.",1
For who would represent an enrichment?,1
The Arabs want to impose their religion and to rule in our home. They must be sent back to their house on boats.,0
We must encourage the encounter between different cultures.,1
"Muslims in a few years will impose their beliefs, and I want to see all the radical-chic bleeding hearts that will have to wear the veil!",0

"Your position is clearly the result of insecurity against these people who have nothing less of us. They are human beings with a different religion and habits, but nothing less than us. We are all human beings!",1
The veil is an indument and personal symbol that every woman can choose to wear or not. For Iranian women is an object for participating actively in public life and to feel emancipated. I do not see it as a constraint.,1

I do not see how in a secular country the lack of religious symbols in schools can be a lack of respect.,1

There is no replacement in Italy because Muslims are less than 5% of the population.,1
Don't confuse Islam with Isis. Religion does not lead to terrorism.,1

"Hi, could you better explain your statement? In what context do you believe there has been an alleged adaptation of our culture to that of citizens who profess the Muslim faith?",1
"Speaking of invasion isn't very correct, considering the number of people who have settled permanently in Italy after they arrived in recent years. Our law guarantees the right of everyone to live their culture in freedom: this is the definition of enrichment: bringing something that was not there, that can teach something new.",1
"Arab is only a generic word precisely as Europeans or Americans that does not consider the many differences existing and in any case, sow fear is the true gesture that should be condemned.",1
I do not understand from what you can say that Islamics want to force us to adapt to their culture.,1
A real Islamic invasion is taking place.,0

Italy is a secular country and Muslims have every right to build places of worship in which the community can come together and pray.,1
It's like saying that Italians are all mobsters and they deserve life imprisonment.,1
